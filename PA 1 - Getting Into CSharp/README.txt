// Description: A readme text file that gives a general overview of "PA1 - Getting Into CSharp".

	All project files:
		- World.cs
		- Animal.cs
		- Cat.cs
		- Elephant.cs
		- Cassowary.cs
		- README.txt

	Instructions for World.cs:
		1.) Enter desired number to start adding information for your desired animal
		2.) Enter all information asked by the console 
		3.) Type "Yes" or "yes" to hear the call of the animal you added to the animal List (if you want to)
		4.) Type "Yes" or "yes" to increment the animal's age by 1 year (if you want to)
		5.) After these steps, the menu will loop back to step 1 unless you type 0, which will exit the program

	Aspects of project I could improve on:
		- Leanring how to work with Lists inside different functions and if-else statements
		- Learning how to clean up Main efficiently
		- Learning more on how child classes can access and use parent's private data members
